Description:
Developed a web-based portal to centralize and streamline student data management for academic institutions. The system allows teachers to securely upload, manage, and update attendance records, marks, and performance details in a structured database. Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using PHP and MySQL to ensure efficient handling of large student datasets.
To maintain data security, a role-based authentication system was integrated, providing different access levels for teachers and administrators. The platform also supports automated report generation in CSV and PDF formats, enabling quick analysis and sharing of academic insights.
Additionally, the system includes an interactive dashboard to display attendance trends, performance summaries, and subject-wise insights, helping teachers identify weak areas and improve academic planning.
